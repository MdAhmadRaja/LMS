# Library Management System (C++)
## Project Overview
The Library Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ to help manage books efficiently within a library. It provides functionalities to add, search, update, delete, and issue books, ensuring smooth operations for both library staff and users. The program follows a menu-driven approach, allowing users to interact with the system via a command-line interface.

## Functionalities Implemented
The system offers the following key features:

Insert New Record – Allows users to add new books to the library database by entering book details.
Search Record – Enables users to search for specific books using relevant criteria such as book ID or title.
Update Record – Provides an option to modify book details like author name, quantity, or category.
Delete Record – Allows users to remove a book record from the library database.
Show All Records – Displays the complete list of books available in the library along with their details.
Issue Book – Facilitates book issuance to users by updating the book’s availability status.
Return Book – Allows users to return an issued book, updating its availability in the system.
Exit – Provides an option to close the program.
## Technology Used
Programming Language: C++
Development Environment: Dev-C++ (as seen in the image)
Concepts Used: File handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures (arrays, classes, and functions).
